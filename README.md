## Synopsis

Lazy Chef is a web application prototype that allows users to select recipes, from which Lazy Chef generates an ingredient shopping list and a sequence of micro-instructions to guide the user through completing all the recipes in the least amount of time. The interface for instructions features an array of timers, progress of action items (e.g. chopping mushrooms), upcoming tasks, and progress of background tasks (e.g. boiling water).

Lazy Chef features a robust recipe import system, that takes a simple, human readable file and adds it to a library of recipes. The library can generate a set of instructions for any set of recipes in the library whose prerequisite ingredients are listed. 

Lazy Chef was implemented in Python and Javascript. Thorough documentation for the Python backend is provided via docstring.
