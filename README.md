# Lazy Chef
Lazy Chef is a web application prototype that allows users to select recipes, from which Lazy Chef generates a ingredient shopping list and a Cook Clock.

A Cook Clock is an app that presents a sequence of timed tasks with instructions and automatic chaining for each task that allows users to simply follow recipe instructions one by one, without having to refer to the recipe directly, to transition between recipes, or to optimize idle time between tasks; Cook Clock finds the optimal sequence of action items for a user to perform in order to create the selected recipes.
